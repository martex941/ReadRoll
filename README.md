# **What is ReadRoll?**

ReadRoll is a website which allows the user to "roll" a book. *What does that mean?* The user is shown a choice between various book genres and can choose one at a time. After the user clicks on one of the genres they are directed to their "rolled" book. The main feature of the website is the ability to generate a random book based on the chosen genre. ReadRoll uses Google Books API to achieve this. When the book is rolled the website displays information about it. There is also an option to buy the book i.e. be redirected to one of the hyperlinks to Amazon's website.

# Languages/Frameworks used:
- HTML
- CSS (and bootstrap)
- JavaScript
- Python (Flask)
- SQLite3
- [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/)

# Overview

# **1. Python and flask**

**1.1 app.py**

This is the file which contains all of the necessary functions for the website to work properly. It has 9 different routes.

**1.1.1 Index and About**

Both *index* and *about* render their specified html template. They do not have any other functions.

**1.1.2 Book_view and Library**

*Book_view* and *library* routes work together as the *book_view* template can only be accessed through the *library* template by choosing one of the displayed books.

*Library* fetches all of the books from the SQLite3 library table using the logged user's id from users table and then it creates a dictionary with the help of the row_factory function. This method is used quite extensively, therefore, I will refer to it as a conversion to dictionary in the following parts.
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM library WHERE user_id=?", (session["user_id"],))
lib = cursor.fetchall()
library = [dict(i) for i in lib]
```
*Library* function also detects a POST request from a search form. It displays the full library if the form is empty or displays the library based on the search query. It does so even if the query is not fully complete by using the LIKE keyword. The query can be either the title of a book or its authors.
```python
search_query = request.form.get("search-text")
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM library WHERE user_id=? AND book_name LIKE ? OR user_id=? AND authors LIKE ?", (session["user_id"], f'%{search_query}%', session["user_id"], f'%{search_query}%'))
```

*Book_view* function takes an argument of "book_id" from the SQLite3 library table and uses it to fetch that specific book from the user's library. The data is then converted to a dictionary. The function also "listens" for a POST request and deletes the book from the user's library if the request is detected. After that it displays a message using the flash function.
```python
if request.method == 'POST':
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM library WHERE user_id=? AND book_id=?", (session["user_id"], book_id))
    db.commit()
    flash(f"{book_name} has been deleted from your library.")
    return redirect('/library')
```

**1.1.3 History**

The *history* function selects all data from the user's istory SQLite3 table and converts them into a dictionary to be then displayed on the website.

**1.1.4 Rolled**

*Rolled* is the biggest function in app.py. It takes an argument of "genre" and utilizes it in the *search_books* function from functions.py to obtain specified amount of books as list of items(dictionaries) from Google Books API. Random index is generated with the help of *randint* which is then used to get a random book from the list.
```python
while True:
        try:
            data = search_books(genre)
            book_count = len(data["items"])
            random_book_index = random.randint(0, book_count - 1)
            random_book = data["items"][random_book_index]["volumeInfo"]
            break
```
Basic iformation about the book is then put into multiple variables in order to be displayed in the html template.

The function allows additional perks if the user is logged in. When a book is rolled, it is automatically added to the history table under the id of the user. It also has a threshold of 50 books per user so if the user has 50 books the last book added is deleted and the newest book takes the highest place.
```python
if session.get("user_id"):
    cursor.execute("SELECT position_id FROM history WHERE user_id=?", (session["user_id"],))
    positions = cursor.fetchall()
    if len(positions) > 50:
        cursor.execute("DELETE FROM history WHERE position_id=? and user_id=?", (positions[0], session["user_id"]))
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO history (book_name, author, user_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", (book_title, book_authors, session["user_id"]))
        db.commit()
    else:
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO history (book_name, author, user_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", (book_title, book_authors, session["user_id"]))
        db.commit()
```

The *rolled* function also detects POST request from the "add-book" form, which as the name indicates lets the user add the rolled book into their library.
```python
if title not in titles_list:
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO library (book_name, authors, book_cover, published_date, book_description, book_genre, book_publisher, book_pages, user_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)", (temp_book_title, temp_book_authors, temp_book_cover, temp_book_date, temp_book_description, temp_book_genre, temp_book_publisher, temp_book_pages, session["user_id"]))
    db.commit()
    flash(f"{temp_book_title} has been added to your library.")

    # This prevents another book being added to the history table as the page refreshes following the POST form submission
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM history WHERE position_id=(SELECT MAX(position_id) FROM history) AND user_id=?", (session["user_id"],))
    db.commit()

    return redirect('/library')
```

**1.1.5 Register, Login and Logout**

These routes/functions work as their names indicate.

*Register* function registers the user. It requires the user to type in their desired username(rejecting it if it is already in the database), their desired password(which must be at least 8 characters long) and then to confirm their password. The function hashes the password using the PBKDF2 method from werkzeug.security library.

*Login* function allows the registered user to log into their account. It checks whether the username exists in the database and then checks if the password hashes match with the said username.

Logout function logs the user out and redirects them to the main page.

**1.2 functions.py**

**1.2.1 Login_required**

This function is taken from the Problem Set 9: Finance. It Allows certain functions to work only if the session contains "user_id".

**1.2.2 Search_books**

This function works together with the *rolled* function from app.py. It obtains the API_KEY which the developer must set before they start the program(the program does not start without it). The function contacts Google Books API and uses the page_size query of 10. This number can be raised up to 40 and the maximum amount of books obtained is capped at 1000. Number 10 is only there for testing purposes to not hit the threshold of API's daily quota and can be modified to the desires of the developer. The downside of it is that book generation times get longer as the number of pages and page sizes get bigger, however, making pages longer and page numbers higher makes the variety of the retrieved books much richer. After contacting the API the function retrieves the data in a json file and returns it.
```python
api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
    page_size = 10
    random_start_index = random.randint(0, page_size)
    url = f'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=subject:{query}&startIndex={random_start_index}&maxResults={page_size}&langRestrict=en&country=US&key={api_key}'
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    return data
```

# **2. Templates**

**2.1 Layout**

The layout template is the basis of the page. It contains everything that is on the page aside from <main>. Therefore it has the <head>, <nav> and <footer>. 
<head> contains links to bootstrap, local css and javascript static files and the icon file. 
<footer> contains a reference to Google Books API website. 
<nav> contains links to all necessary pages. My favourite feature is the dark/light theme. The navigation bar is also dynamic in terms of changing resolution.

**2.2 Index**

Index page contains a set of bootstrap cards, each of them shows an exemplary book cover of a given genre as well as the name of each genre in the card header. There are 25 genres to chose from and they represent genres present in Google Books.

**2.3 Rolled**

Rolled template contains a little bit of CSS code which helps the page stay dynamic during resolution changes. It needed the most personal tweaks as it has the biggest variety of objects out of all pages: buttons, headers, cards, images, long descriptions and flashing messages.

The page itself takes variables from the *rolled* function and displays them using jinja syntax and bootstrap cards.
![Example of a rolled book](./static/rolled_example.png)

**2.4 Library and book_view**

Library has a dynamic display of cards achieved by using a for loop in jinja syntax. It displays the cards similarily to the index page, however, it does update automatically utilizing the user's SQLite3 library table. The cards are interactable, they can be clicked and direct user to the book_view page which displays information about the selected book.

Book_view template works similarily to the rolled template, the only difference is in buttons. While the rolled template allows the user to change the genre, roll another book and (if logged in) add the book to their library, the book_view template only has the "delete from library" button which does as the name indicates. After deletion the user is redirected to the library template and a message indicates the successful deletion of the book.

**2.5 History**

History template uses a table to display the last 50 books rolled by the user. It contains the title of the book, names of authors and a date and time of when the book was rolled by the user.

**2.6 Login and register**

Login and register templates are simple POST method forms that allow the user to make their account and then login with the aforementioned account.

# **3. Static files**

**3.1 CSS**
There are two css files. 
One of them is style_fixed_footer.css, which is useful when the library page does not fill the screen as there are just a few books there. The footer then would sit right under the books. I utilize javascript to make the style_fixed_footer.css turn on or off depending on whether the scrollbar is present or not.

The other css file, style.css, contains all the useful styling code for all of the templates. I'd like to highlight my favourite feature which is the dark/light color theme. The code also contains commented out shades of other colors I've tried and left out for other developers to mix and match to their liking.
```css
/* THEME COLORS*/
.light-theme {
    /* LIGHT THEME */
    /* --ash-gray: #96bbbbff;
    --hookers-green: #618985ff;
    --black-olive: #414535ff;
    --dutch-white: #f2e3bcff; */
    --background-color: #96bbbbff;
    --primary-color: #618985ff;
    --card-color: #618985ff;
    --text-color: rgb(235, 234, 172);
}

.dark-theme {
     /* DARK THEME */
     /* --almond: #f1dac4ff;
     --oxford-blue: #161b33ff;
     --rich-black: #0d0c1dff; */
    --background-color: #161b33ff;
    --primary-color: #0d0c1dff;
    --card-color: #0d0c1dff;
    --text-color: #f1dac4ff;
}
```
Another interesting addition is the customized scrollbar, which I dont see on many webpages and I think it is a simple but cool thing to have on a website.
```css
/* SCROLLBAR */
::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 10px;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    background-color: #999999;
    border-radius: 5px;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
    background-color: #f8f8f8;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```

**3.2 JS**

The script.js file contains code for the dark/light theme and the fixed footer css file.

This allows the theme button in navigation bar to change classes of body element in layout.html between dark-theme and light-theme class.
```javascript
function toggleSwitch() {
    var body = document.getElementById("html-body");
    body.classList.toggle("dark-theme");

    // Save the user's theme preference in local storage
    if (body.classList.contains("dark-theme")) {
        localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark");
    } 

    else {
        localStorage.setItem("theme", "light");
    }
}
```
This makes sure that the theme which has been previously set stays the same as the user clicks between the pages.
```javascript
function setTheme() {
    var body = document.getElementById("html-body");
    var theme = localStorage.getItem("theme");

    if (theme === "dark") {
        body.classList.add("dark-theme");
    } 

    else {
        body.classList.remove("dark-theme");
    }
}
```

The other fun highlight is the fixed footer code. It detects whether the scrollbar is present in the window of the page. If so then the fixed footer link is enabled.
```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    const fixedFooterCSS = document.getElementById('fixed-footer');
    const hasScrollbar = () => document.documentElement.scrollHeight > window.innerHeight;
    const toggleFixedFooterCSS = () => {
      if (hasScrollbar()) {
        fixedFooterCSS.disabled = true;
      } else {
        fixedFooterCSS.disabled = false;
      }
    };
    toggleFixedFooterCSS();
    window.addEventListener('resize', toggleFixedFooterCSS);
    window.addEventListener('scroll', toggleFixedFooterCSS);
  });
```
```html
  <link id="fixed-footer" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style_fixed_footer.css') }}">
```

# **4. Databases**

**4.1 readroll.db**

This is the only database file and it contains 4 tables. 

First one is the "users" table which stores usernames, user id's and hashed passwords of registered users. 

Second one is the "library" table, it stores information about the rolled books which have been added to libraries of each user. The table holds all of the books from all users, however, the library from each user can be easily selected using the user_id key which is related to the id key from "users" table. The information includes book's title, authors, number of pages, name of the publisher, genre, description, the book cover, the date the book was published, and lastly the date and time when the book was added to the library.

The third table is "temp_library", this table works just like "library" table can hold the maximum of 2 books per user. It acts as kind of a buffer for adding books to the library. It's existence is crucial, because when the "add to library" form is submitted using POST method the page immidiately refreshes and therefore adds the book from the refreshed page to the library instead of the previous one. This has been one of the major problems I encountered in this project and creating a buffer-like library was the best solution I could come up with. I have tried using AJAX in JavaScript to stop the page from refreshing following the POST form submission, however, the prevention of the default behaviour of the form was conflicting with the Flask function and either did not add the book to the library or added the wrong book anyways.

The fourth and the last one is the "history" table. As it's name indicates it holds the recent books rolled by the users. Each user can have up to 50 recent books. This limit has no impact on the functionality of the website and can be easily modified, I just wanted the "history" table to have one.
